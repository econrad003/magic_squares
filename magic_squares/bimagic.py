bimagic.py - does a square matrix become a magic square when its entries are squared?
Copyright Â© 2025 by Eric Conrad

DESCRIPTION

    A Parker magic square is a semi-magic square whose entries, when squared,
    form a magic square.  The name was apparently coined in a numberphile
    video after Matt Parker who found a 3x3 example.

    A bimagic square is a Parker magic square which is also a magic square.
    Georges Pfeffermann apparently found the first example in 1890.

    A p-multimagic square is a square matrix for which the entries raised to
    each of the powers d=1, 2, ..., p all form magic squares.  So a bimagic
    square is a 2-multimagic square, and conversely.  Similarly, a trimagic
    square is 3-multimagic, and so on for prefixes like tetra-, penta-, hexa-
    and hepta-.

    Leonhard Euler found a 3x3 example of a square matrix whose entries, when
    squared, form a magic square.  (His example is not a Parker square.)

    Implemented here is a function:

        powermagic - test whether a given square matrix forms a magic square
            when its entries are raised to a given power.

    In addition, there are procedures (example1, example2, example3, example4) which
    return specific examples.  The main routine displays the results from the
    example in a somewhat user-friendly fashion.

    REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

        square - a square matrix

    OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

        d - the power to be tested; the default is 2 to square the entries.

        diagonals - if False, then the test is for a semi-magic square; the
            default is True.

        warnings - if this is True, then a message is also displayed when the
            test fails; the default is False.

    RETURN VALUE

        If the test succeeds, the resulting magic (or semi-magic) square is
        returned.  If the test fails, the value False is returned.
